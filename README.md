## Introduction:
With all that is happening around us and being forced to work remotely, we are led to dismiss the most important thing in our lives, ourselves. The result of not taking care of oneself is the deprivation of our mental and physical health.

This then can lead to anxiety and depression. In order to combat these issues, we decided to focus on improving oneself by setting reminders of vital aspects every individual should set time for. Such aspects that require our attention is when to go to sleep, have our meals, partake in physical activity, and setting time for ourselves.

By being reminded of these vital aspects that determine our well-being, we could then take action and make a drastic impact in our mental and physical health.
 
## How it works:
The user first inputs the tasks, events, or activities they want to be reminded on. The user then enters the date and time of when to be reminded and their phone number to be able to receive the reminder via text when it is time. Finally, the user is then reminded and can take action.

## Behind the scenes:
In order for this project to work, it required understanding of Python, JavaScript, Twilio API, HTML, and CSS. With the use of HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript, we were able to provide an appropriate interface a user can interact with.
With the use of Twilio API, we were able to send text messages with the phone number they provided.

With the use of an internal list, we were able to store the information and retrieve it when necessary. With the combination of these, we were able to produce this project.
